# docker-csc2fa-http-proxy

> Cisco Secure Client (2FA) + Privoxy

## Configurations

```shell
echo vpn.server.name >server_name.txt
host $(cat server_name.txt) | grep "has address" | awk '{print $NF}' >server_ip.txt
echo username >username.txt
echo password >password.txt
```

## 2FA

Install an authenticator into your device:

* Microsoft Authenticator (tested)
* Google Authenticator (**NOT TESTED**)

## Cisco Secure Client

Copy an archive file of [Cisco Secure Client 5] in this folder as `package.tar.gz`.  It must
contains the following scripts:

* `<dir>/vpn/vpn_install.sh`
* `<dir>/dart/dart_install.sh`

See [setup.sh](./setup.sh) for details.

## How to use

Create a container for the `proxy` service:

```shell
# $USER/csc2fa-http-proxy image will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
# `docker compose build` builds it manually.
# See compose.yaml for details.
docker compose up -d
```

The container starts an [Openbox] session.  The screen can be accessible by using a modern web
browser via [noVNC] and [x11vnc].

Open `http://localhost:5980/vnc_auto.html` in your web browser.  You can see that [xdotool] will
enter texts on the Cisco Secure Client window and dialog automatically instead of you.  Wait a
moment for PIN code to be shown.

Finally, enter the PIN code on the authenticator and close the dialog on the noVNC screen after the
authentication finishes successfully.

The [Privoxy] running in the container proxies requests to servers in the private network.  It can
be accessible with `http://localhost:8118`.

## Technical Notes

`LocalLanAccess` must be enabled in `/opt/cisco/secureclient/vpn/.anyconnect_global` in order to
allow accesses from outside the container.
